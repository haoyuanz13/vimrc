# vimrc
my customized vimrc, using vundle to manage. 

```shell
cd
git clone https://github.com/poodarchu/vimrc.git
rm -rf .vim .vimrc
cd vimrc
sh setup.sh
```
when you see warnings such like 'cannot find xxx', ignore them, just press Enter.
After plugins are installed and updated, you'll be free to use it.
